# 🍅 Tomato Disease Classification Using CNN 🌱

This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system for classifying tomato plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to assist farmers in early disease detection and crop management, ultimately improving crop yield and reducing economic losses.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 Implemented a CNN model using TensorFlow for accurate disease classification
- 🪛 Data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data
- 🔧 Model quantization for optimized performance on mobile devices
- 🚀 Achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in disease classification
- 🌐 Deployed the model using FastAPI and TensorFlow Serving on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- ☁️ Utilized Google Cloud Functions (GCF) for serverless deployment
- 📱 Developed a mobile app (React Native) for seamless disease detection and crop management
- 🌐 Responsive React.js web application for desktop and tablet users
